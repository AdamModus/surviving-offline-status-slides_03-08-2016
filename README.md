#Surviving the offline status

# 03/08/2016
This is just the repo of the slides me and Antoni (the initial contributors) at the Frontend Coding Midsummer Meetup on 03/08/2016

It's still not the final version of what we have to say about this subject, but it'll evolve in the future, to be used elsewhere in a much more completed and presentable fashion (this is only version 0.1!)

# Setup
* Just open the index.html file on your browser, it even works offline
* Have fun :)
